Even though you cannot hear it the game supports sound effects... üí•

### Controls
The game supports both mouse and keyboard usage. 
Controlling the game with a mouse is straightforward and does not require additional explanation.
Keybindings are listed below: 
* `q` - quit the game
* `1` - change bird's color
* `2` - change background's color
* `SPACEBAR` - action button - flap/process to the next screen

### How to use
* Clone the repository
* Install requirements calling:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
* Switch to python 3.8 if you haven't done it already and then run:
```bash
python3 -m flappy
```

### Tech
* python 3.8
* pygame 2.0.1

### TBD
* Collision detection between the bird and obstacles should be more accurate 
* In the original project instead of falling infinitely down the bird was stopped by a pavement
